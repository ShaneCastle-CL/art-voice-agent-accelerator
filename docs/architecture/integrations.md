## 4. LLM Integration Patterns

> **üìö Microsoft Learn Resources:**
> - [Azure OpenAI Service Integration Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/community/content/azure-openai-azure-speech-gpt-4) - Voice-enabled chatbot with GPT-4 and Azure Speech Services
> - [GPT Realtime API for Speech and Audio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/realtime-audio-quickstart) - Real-time voice interaction capabilities

**Scenario:** FastAPI backend needs to invoke LLMs for chat intelligence, summarization, or agent decision-making.

### 4.1 Provider Integration Points

**Azure OpenAI Service:**
- Use `azure-ai` Python SDK or REST API for deployed models (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)
- Secure with managed identity or service principal from Azure Key Vault
- Endpoint: `POST https://{your-resource}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{deployment}/completions`

**AWS Bedrock / SageMaker:**
- Route LLM requests via AWS Lambda or direct SDK calls
- Secure with IAM roles and AWS SDK credentials

**Other LLM Providers:**
- Support pluggable adapter pattern for OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, or self-hosted models
- Consider LangChain abstractions for provider flexibility

### 4.2 LLM Evaluation & Fine-Tuning

**Azure AI Foundry Integration:**
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics (safety, coherence, relevance, fluency)
- Built-in evaluation flows for A/B testing prompts, models, and configurations
- Use Azure AI Foundry's evaluation SDK: `from azure.ai.evaluation import evaluate_conversation`

**AWS vs Azure Evaluation Support:**
- **Azure**: AI Foundry offers end-to-end evaluation pipelines with visual dashboards
- **AWS**: Bedrock provides model evaluation but requires more manual setup for conversation metrics
- Azure's evaluation tooling is more mature for chat AI scenarios

**Iterative Improvement Workflow:**
- Implement evaluation checkpoints in FastAPI endpoints
- Use session-based evaluation data for prompt improvements
- Set up automated evaluation pipelines triggered by deployment

### 4.3 Design Considerations

- Abstract provider-specific logic behind common interface in `handlers/llm` module
- Manage prompt templates and rate limits
- Ensure chat context (session_id) is passed for continuity
- Implement retry and fallback strategies

---

## 5. Validation & Testing

**Proof-of-Concept Validation:**
- Validate prompt/response formats and latency for each provider under real-world load
- Benchmark throughput and error rates
- Test cross-cloud connectivity and security
- Validate compliance and data residency requirements

**Performance Testing:**
