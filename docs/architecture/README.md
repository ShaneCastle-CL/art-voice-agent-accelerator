    **Current Terraform**: Container Apps with public endpoints for rapid development
    
    **Available Bicep**: Enterprise production architecture with API Management, and private networking. (Advanced, WIP)

## :material-cloud-outline: Deployment Architecture
=== "üèóÔ∏è Simplified Azure Production"
    **Streamlined deployment with Container Apps and public endpoints**
    
    ![Simplified Production Architecture](../assets/RTAudio.v0.png)
    
    *Current Terraform deployment with Container Apps, AI Foundry, and public endpoints. App Gateway, APIM, and private networking are intentionally excluded to maintain simplicity and flexibility for rapid development.*

=== "üîß Detailed Component View"
    **Agent framework and processing pipeline architecture**
    
    ![Agent Architecture](../assets/ARTAgentarch.png)
    
    *Detailed view of the agent orchestration, processing components, and data flow patterns within the simplified production architecture.*

=== "üéôÔ∏è Voice Live Orchestration"
    **Real-time voice processing with live orchestration**
    
    ![Voice Live API](../assets/LIVEVOICEApi.png)
    
    *Voice live orchestration architecture showing real-time audio processing, conversation management, and agent coordination patterns.*

!!! note "Infrastructure Deployment Approach"
    The Terraform deployment intentionally excludes App Gateway, API Management, and private networking to provide a **malleable foundation** that consumers can extend based on their specific requirements. Production enterprise features are available through separate Bicep templates.

*Azure infrastructure with Container Apps, AI Foundry, and public endpoints*
