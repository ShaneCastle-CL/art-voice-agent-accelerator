## :material-microsoft-azure: Azure Setup Requirements

!!! note "Required Azure Resources"
    The accelerator requires these Azure services for full functionality:

| Service | Purpose | Required For |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Speech Services** | Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text | All voice features |
| **Communication Services** | Phone calls, WebSocket media | Phone integration |
| **AI Foundry / OpenAI** | Conversation intelligence | AI agent responses |
| **Redis Cache** | Session state management | Multi-turn conversations |
| **Cosmos DB** | Conversation persistence | Analytics, compliance |

**Quick Azure Setup**:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/art-voice-agent-accelerator.git
cd art-voice-agent-accelerator

# Deploy infrastructure (choose one)
azd provision  # Azure Developer CLI (recommended)
# or use Terraform/Bicep directly
```
